# Hi, I'm [Sameer](https://wsameer.github.io/v1/) 👋 👨‍💻

I am a JavaScript ninja who is passionate about buidling things that dwell on the internet. Some technologies I enjoy working with include JavaScript, Angular, ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup), HTML/CSS, GraphQL. My aim is to deliver pixel perfect user interfaces built on top of modern JavaScript based frameworks ensuring responsiveness and cross-browser support.
