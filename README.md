### Hi, I'm Sameer 👋 👨‍💻

🐱‍👤 I am a JavaScript ninja who is passionate about developing things that dwell on the internet. 

🌱 Be it a static or a dynamic web application, custom component/plugin, responsive website, or anything in between, I have got it all covered. Some technologies I enjoy working with include JavaScript, Angular, ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup), HTML/CSS, GraphQL.

🎯 My aim is to deliver pixel perfect user interfaces built on top of modern JavaScript based frameworks ensuring responsiveness and cross-browser support.
